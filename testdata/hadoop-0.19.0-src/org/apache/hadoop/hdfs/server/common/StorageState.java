/**
 * Storage information file.
 * <p>
 * Local storage information is stored in a separate file VERSION.
 * It contains type of the node, 
 * the storage layout version, the namespace id, and 
 * the fs state creation time.
 * <p>
 * Local storage can reside in multiple directories. 
 * Each directory should contain the same VERSION file as the others.
 * During startup Hadoop servers (name-node and data-nodes) read their local 
 * storage information from them.
 * <p>
 * The servers hold a lock for each storage directory while they run so that 
 * other nodes were not able to startup sharing the same storage.
 * The locks are released when the servers stop (normally or abnormally).
